# Academic Paper Updates - Summary

## Major Changes Made

### 1. Title Update
- **New Title**: "An Algebraic Framework for Language Model Composition with Efficient Suffix-Based Grounding"
- Emphasizes both the algebraic framework and suffix array efficiency

### 2. Abstract Rewrite
- Highlights the comprehensive operator set (10 operators total)
- Emphasizes 34x memory efficiency with suffix arrays
- Quantifies improvements: 70% perplexity reduction, 2.66ms overhead (6.5%)
- Shows elegant one-line model expressions

### 3. Rich Algebraic Framework (Section 2 Expansion)
**New Operators Added:**
- `|` (maximum): Takes max probability across models
- `&` (minimum): Conservative predictions via minimum
- `⊕` (XOR): Highlights model disagreement
- `**` (temperature): Entropy adjustment
- `>>` (threshold): Filters low-confidence predictions
- `<<` (transform): Context transformations
- `~` (complement): Probability inversion

**Mathematical Properties:**
- Associativity: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
- Distributivity: α(a + b) = αa + αb
- Composability: Transforms can be chained

### 4. Suffix Arrays Section (New)
**Key Points:**
- Replaces n-gram hash tables entirely
- Memory: O(n) vs O(n²) for all n-grams
- 34x memory reduction (1GB vs 34GB for Wikipedia)
- Variable-length pattern matching
- O(m log n) query time with binary search

### 5. Context Transformations (New Section)
**Four Sophisticated Transforms:**
- `LongestSuffixTransform`: Variable-length matching
- `RecencyWeightTransform`: Exponential decay for temporal coherence
- `MaxKWordsTransform`: Context windowing
- `FocusTransform`: Attention-based weighting

### 6. Advanced Compositional Models (New Section)
**Four New Model Types:**
- `AdaptiveSuffixModel`: Dynamic weight adjustment
- `RecencyBiasedModel`: Temporal coherence
- `CacheModel`: LRU cache for frequent predictions
- `AttentionModel`: Context-aware weighting

### 7. Experimental Results Updates
**New Benchmarks:**
- Suffix arrays vs n-gram comparison tables
- Production integration with Ollama (2.66ms overhead)
- Coverage improvements: 42% → 88% with transforms
- Memory efficiency: 34x reduction demonstrated

### 8. Practical Examples Section (New)
**Code Patterns Added:**
```python
# One-line sophisticated model
model = (0.7 * llm + 0.2 * (wiki << LongestSuffix(20)) + 0.1 * ngram) ** 0.9

# Production system
model = (
    0.7 * llm +
    0.15 * (wiki_sa << LongestSuffix(20)) +
    0.1 * (news_sa << RecencyWeight(0.9)) +
    0.05 * cache_model
) ** 0.85 >> threshold(0.1) @ json_constraint
```

### 9. Key Message Updates

**After:** Emphasizes:
- Mathematical elegance of the full framework
- Suffix array efficiency (34x memory savings)
- Rich operator algebra enabling complex behaviors
- Production-ready with minimal overhead (6.5%)
