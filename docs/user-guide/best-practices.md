Tips and recommendations for using LangCalc effectively.

## Performance

- Use augmentations for simple transformations
- Profile before optimizing
- Choose appropriate max_length for infinigrams

## Composition

- Follow canonical projection ordering
- Test both projection and augmentation approaches
- Start simple and add complexity incrementally

## Testing

- Verify projections with small test cases
- Check model composition properties
- Measure query latency
